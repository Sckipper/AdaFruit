# AdaFruit

Windows form app that can scan BLE devices. It connects with two Adafruit sensors to receive accelerometer, magnetometer and giroscope data from them: 
- Green LSM9d50 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2020)
- Purple LSM303 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1247)

The sensors are placed on the arm and forearm of a patient that will execute a medical recovery exercise. Sensors are connected to a 200mA batery each.

Sensors record data and send it to the windows app that will calculate Pitch and Roll and will give a result (poor, mild, good).
